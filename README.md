# TailwindUI Vue -> React

This repository is an example of how Vue components in https://github.com/tailwindui/vue could work in React.

You can find a basic example for Listbox in `./pages/index.jsx`.

This is not in any way affiliated with TailwindCSS. I used to write a lot of Vue 2 years ago and now mostly use React so this is a small challenge to keep up to date with Vue without using it.
